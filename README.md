# API and Getting Started
Check out [Project OWL] for quickstart videos
### Downloading Library from GitHub
For ease of use, we will need to copy the library into your Arduino library folder.
1. Copy ClusterDuck folder
2. Navigate to your ``Arduino`` folder. This can be found in your default Documents folder.
3. Navigate to the ``library`` folder
4. Paste into ``library`` folder
5. Restart Arduino
6. You should now be able to see examples by going to File -> Examples -> ClusterDuck

You should be able pull new commits directly to this folder in your Arduino library.

### Quick Start
Open new sketch in Adruino IDE and include the ClusterDuck library

    #include "ClusterDuck.h"
Create ClusterDuck object

    ClusterDuck duck;
Initializes the ClusterDuck class object

##### In setup()

    duck.begin(baudRate);
Initializes the baude rate for serial printing and messaging. You can adust to your desired baude rate.
- int baudRate
-- Default is **115000**

Set device ID and captive portal form length.
    
    duck.setDeviceId(String deviceId, const int formLength);
- String deviceId
-- input the device ID used to identify your registered device on the web
-- do not leave null or empty string
- const int formLength 
-- (optional) define the number of captive portal form fields
-- Default is **10** to match our default captive portal template

Setup **DuckLink**

    duck.setupDuckLink();
    
``duck.setupMamaDuck`` can also be used here to setup a MamaDuck, however you **cannot** use both in the same sketch.

#### In loop()

Add cooresponding Duck run code. Must be of the same device type as used in ``setup()``. (e.g. if ``duck.setupMamaDuck()`` is used in ``setup()`` use ``duck.runMamaDuck()``)

    duck.runDuckLink();
    
Your sketch should look something like this:
    
    #include "ClusterDuck.h"
    ClusterDuck duck;
    
    void setup() {
    // put your setup code here, to run once:
        duck.begin();
        duck.setDeviceId("Z", 10);
        duck.setupDuckLink();
    }

    void loop() {
    // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:
        duck.runDuckLink();
    }

Now compile and upload to your device. If using a Heltec LoRa ESP32 board you should see a Duck Online message on the LED screen. You can now open your phone or laptop's wifi preferences and connect to the ``SOS DuckLink Network``!

## API
``setDeviceId(String deviceId, const int formLength)``
- Set device ID and captive portal form length. Do not leave **deviceId** *null* or as an empty string. **formLength** defaults to 10. Use in ``setup()``.

``void begin(int baudRate)``
- Initialize baude rate for serial. Use in ``setup()``.

``void setupDisplay(String deviceType)``
- Initializes LED screen on Heltec LoRa ESP32 and configures it to show status, device ID, and the device type. Use in ``setup()``.

``void setupLoRa(long BAND, int SS, int RST, int DI0, int TxPower)``
- Initializes LoRa radio. If using **Heltec LoRa ESP32** set **SS** to , **RST** to and **DIO** to . **TxPower** corresponds to the the transmit power of the radio (max value: 20). Use in ``setup()``.

``void setupPortal(const char *AP)``
- Initializes the captive portal code. ***AP** is the value that will be displayed when accessing the wifi settings of devices such as smartphones and laptops. Use in ``setup()``.

``bool runCaptivePortal()``
- Processes requests coming through the captive portal. Returns ``true`` if there is a new submission. Use this in your ``loop()`` function to run continuously. 

``void setupDuckLink()``
- Template for setting up a **DuckLink** device. Use in ``setup()``

``void runDuckLink()``
- Template for running core functionality of a **DuckLink**. Use in ``loop()``.

``void setupMamaDuck()``
- Template for setting up a **MamaDuck** device. Use in ``setup()``.

``void runMamaDuck()``
- Template for running core functionality of a **MamaDuck**. Use in ``loop()``.

``String * getPortalDataArray()``
- Returns webserver arguments based on **formLength** as an array of ``Strings``.

``String getPortalDataString()``
- Returns webserver arguments based on **formLength** as a single String with arguments separated by *

``void sendPayloadMessage(String msg)``
- Packages **msg** into a LoRa packet and sends over LoRa. Will automatically set the current device's ID as the sender ID and create a UUID for the message.

``void sendPayloadStandard(String msg, String senderId = "", String messageId = "", String path = "")`` 
- Similar to and might replace ``sendPayloadMessage()``. **senderId** is the ID of the originator of the message. **messageId** is the UUID of the message. **ms** is the message payload to be sent. **path** is the recorded pathway of the message and is used as a check to prevent the device from sending multiple of the same message.

``void couple(byte byteCode, String outgoing)``
- Writes data to LoRa packet. **outgoing** is the payload data to be sent. **byteCode** is paired with the **outgoing** so it can be used to identify data on an individual level. Reference ``setDeviceId()`` for byte codes. In addition it writes the **outgoing** length to the LoRa packet. 
- Use between a ``LoRa.beginPacket()`` and ``LoRa.endPacket()`` (**note:** ``LoRa.endPacket()`` will send the LoRa packet)

``String readMessages(byte mLength)``
- Returns a String. Used after ``LoRa.read()`` to convert LoRa packet into a String.

``bool checkPath(String path)``
- Checks if the **path** contains **deviceId**. Returns bool.

``String * getPacketData(int pSize)``
- Called to iterate through received LoRa packet and return data as an array of Strings.
- Note: if using standerd byte codes it will store **senderId**, **messageId**, **payload**, and **path** in a Packet object. This can be accessed using ``getLastPacket()``

``void restartDuck()``
- If using the ESP32 architecture, calling this function will reboot the device.

``void reboot(void *)``
- Used to call ``restartDuck()`` when using a timer

``void imAlive(void *)``
- Used to send a '1' over LoRa on a timer to signify the device is still on and functional.

``String duckMac(boolean format)``
- Returns the MAC address of the device. Using ``true`` as an argument will return the MAC address formatted using ':'

``String uuidCreator()``
- Returns as String of 8 random characters and numbers

``String getDeviceId()``
- Returns the device ID

``Packet getLastPacket()``
- Returns a Packet object containing **senderId**, **messageId**, **payload**, and **path** of last packet received.
- Note: values are updated after running ``getPacketData()``
